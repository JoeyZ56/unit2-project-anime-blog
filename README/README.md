How to make an api request in Postman (i.e what port, what url etc):

Manual testing with Postman:

    URL: http://localhost:3000, PORT:3000

From breadcrum:

    Body -> raw -> json

For user testing:

    Create user: Post route -> http://localhost:3000/users -> (follow steps from models/user.js) body{
    "name": " ",
    "email": " ",
    "password": " "
    } -> send request

Login user:

    Post route -> http://localhost:3000/users/login -> (remove "name") body{
    "email": " ",
    "password": " "
    }
    copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

Update user:

    Put route -> http://localhost:3000/users/:id -> (only keep what your updating) body{
    "email": "different email"
    } -> (copy :id put at the end of /users/) -> copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

Delete user:

    Delete route -> http://localhost:3000/users/:id -> (copy :id put at the end of /users/) -> copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

Logout user:

    Post route -> http://localhost:3000/users/logout -> copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

For testing Posts: (user must be logged in for testing all routes)

    Create Post: Post route - http://localhost:3000/posts -> body{
    "title": " ",
    "description": " "
    } -> copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

Update Post:

    Put route -> http://localhost:3000/posts/:id -> (only keep what your updating) body{
    "title": " "
    } -> (copy :id put at the end of /users/) -> copy token -> breadcrum: Auth {type: Bearer Token} paste token -> send

Delete Post:

    Delete route -> http://localhost:3000/posts/:id -> (copy :id put at the end of /posts/) -> send

Show user posts:

    Get route -> http://localhost:3000/posts/:id -> (copy :id put at the end of /posts/) -> send

Show posts feed:

    Get route -> http://localhost:3000/posts/feed -> (copy :id put at the end of /posts/) -> send

How to run tests:

    - For Jest testing: From the terminal (make sure your not connected to Mongodb server), write in command line "npm i test" this will start the Jest testing for posts / user tests (ALL 8 should be passing).

    - For Artillery testing: Open a sepreate terminal (make sure your connected to mongodb in the main terminal) cd to the folder that hold all the files for the blog then in that seperate terminal run command "npm run load" (Should get 20 (200) message from results)

How to start the app without dev mode:

    - (Make sure you not in "Dev Mode") in terminal run command "npm run start"
